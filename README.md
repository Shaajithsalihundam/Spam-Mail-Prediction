# Spam Mail Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying emails as spam or non-spam using machine learning. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Text feature extraction (TF-IDF, Count Vectorization, etc.)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kartheek123456/spam-mail-prediction.git
cd spam-mail-prediction
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells step by step to preprocess data, extract features, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of emails labeled as spam or non-spam. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Model Performance
Different machine learning models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
